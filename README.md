# Ember
> This is a work in progress and is only developed occasionally at the moment.
Ember is a new programming language designed to be ease of use for low and high level prorammers whilst meeting and succeeding many gaps and downfalls of other programming languages

This code was built and ran on a Intel I5 Vpro on Linux Manjaro OS. And hasn't been tested on anything else as of yet.
Additionally, some files presented here are temperorary work files that will be removed in later stages when they're not required.
